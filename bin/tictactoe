This is often referred to as a "shebang line" and it tells the shell which
interpreter to use to execute the remainder of the file.

Using the above setup, you can run your program by typing
`ruby bin/< your file name >` into the command line.

Alternatively, you can execute your program by simply typing
 `./bin/< your file name >` into the command line, since the shebang line
 at the top of your executable file is already telling the shell to use Ruby
 to interpret the rest of the file.
